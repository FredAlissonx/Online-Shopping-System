## What did I learn or improve from this project?
With the construction of this project I was able to improve my skills with the Java language and in solving problems that arose during the course of the project, I was able to benefit greatly as I did the project 100% alone without any help or ideas. According to needs, I implemented and arranged features in the program to make it as complete as possible. In the future, I want to evolve this project with new knowledge such as design patterns, unit tests with JUnit, etc.
